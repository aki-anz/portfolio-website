I am a self-taught web developer who specializes in building front-end applications with React.

Developing an app is very exciting to me and I enjoy learning new technologies and reading docs from new library very much.

Also, I am intrigued by how fast and responsive SPAs are and all those nice open source projects are all incredibly exciting to me.
